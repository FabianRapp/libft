## libft

Started as my very first school project. I kept adding functions that i needed for different project.
Many functions follow the school code style guidelines and the allowed functions for diffrent school projects, many don't.


When calling the make file call it with 'make NDEBUG=-NDEBUG' to disable debug mode
